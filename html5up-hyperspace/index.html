									<h2>The Sufferings.</h2>
									<p>Most were suffocated in gas chambers fed by the exhaust of a large petrol engine.[3] Up to 200,000 people were murdered at Sobibór[4] and possibly more. At the postwar trial against the former SS personnel of Sobibór, held in Hagen two decades into the Cold War, Professor Wolfgang Scheffler estimated the number of murdered Jews totalled a minimum of 250,000.</p>

									<h2>The Uprising.</h2>
									<p>At 4:00 p.m. on October 14, 1943, the first SS soldier was killed with an axe. Ten more SS men were killed, as were several Ukrainian guards. Telephone wires and electricity lines were cut. Within an hour, the camp was burning, and guns were aimed at the guard towers.
At sunset, About 300 people—had escaped. Most were killed by their Nazi pursuers or died crossing the minefields. After the revolt, some joined partisan units; others found shelter among sympathetic Poles. It is estimated that just 50 of the escapees survived the war.</p>
